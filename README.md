# REPL HERO
### Guitar Hero... For HACKERS
REPL HERO is a simplified version of guitar hero, written in HTML5, CSS, and JS, with a terminal astethic. It was built for the Repl.it's Online Music Hackathon.

### Installation and Development

To install:
``` bash
  git clone https://github.com/liam-ilan/repl-hero.git
```

Running the localhost is a simple as:
``` bash
  npm run start
```
This will open up the game on localhost:8080

### How to Play
Use the number keys (1 - 5) to play a note when the block hits the blue bar. You have 5 lives (at the bottom), and once those run out, it's game over. Other than that, reach a high score!

### A Word About the Music
The music you play is not random. It was composed on Bosca Ceoil (https://boscaceoil.net/). The game picks which bars to play out of a set of options, which create "acceptable" music.
